Pandas Challenge Week 4

Three Observable Trends 
1. While the majority of purchases come from men, females and those who did not distinguish their gender tend to spend more on average on games than the purchases that came from the male demographic. Men spent on average $4.07, whereas women and those who did not disclose their gender spent $4.47 and $4.56 respectively.

2. Based on the Age Demogrpahics table, we can see that people from the age group of 20 years to 24 years spend the most on games. However, the average price per person total was the highest in the age group of years 35-39, and less than 10 years. This is most likely for the people who have a more dispensible income, and children usually don't have their own money, but their parents will either give them money, or they'll save up their own money to purchase whichever game they have their eye on. 

3. Finally, between the most popular and profitable items, the first two games were both the most popular and the most profitable. However, Fiery Glass Crusader, Persuasion, and Extraction all fell in rankings when compared to the most profitable, even though Nirvana, on the most profitable, was purchased the same amount of times as Fiery Glass Crusader, Persuasion and Extraction. It would be helpful to note that perhaps the company could raise the price of those games at a higher price point since games like Nirvana, which is 40 cents more, is purchased the same amount of times.
